# Diabetes Detection

This project focuses on developing a machine learning model for diabetes detection based on patient health data. Early detection of diabetes is crucial for timely intervention, effective disease management, and reducing long-term health complications.

The project leverages statistical analysis and machine learning techniques to accurately classify individuals as diabetic or non-diabetic based on key health indicators such as glucose levels, BMI, insulin levels, and other relevant factors. By providing reliable predictions, the model aims to assist healthcare professionals and individuals in making informed decisions about diabetes risk and management.
